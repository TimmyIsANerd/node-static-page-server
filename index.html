    <h1>Static Page Server Project</h1>
    <p>Node combined with express make a great combination. That
        combination can be used to create a server that serves static
        assets such as html files, images, stylesheets ect. A great
        project to get your head around how this works, and to get to
        grips with the basics of node, would be to build a static page
        server that serves up content.</p>
